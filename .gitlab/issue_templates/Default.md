  - Try and file the issue against the most [appropriate
    project](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp).  This project is about
    our low-level OpenPGP library.  (If you make a mistake, it's not a
    big deal: it's easy to move issues between projects.)

    issues) to see if someone has opened a similar issue.
