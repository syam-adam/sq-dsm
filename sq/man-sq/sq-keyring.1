.TH SQ-KEYRING "1" "MARCH 2021" "0.24.0 (SEQUOIA-OPENPGP 1.0.0)" "USER COMMANDS" 5
.SH NAME
sq\-keyring \- Manages collections of keys or certs

Collections of keys or certficicates (also known as "keyrings" when
they contain secret key material, and "certrings" when they don't) are
any number of concatenated certificates.  This subcommand provides
tools to list, split, join, merge, and filter keyrings.

Note: In the documentation of this subcommand, we sometimes use the
terms keys and certs interchangeably.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsq keyring\fR [FLAGS] <SUBCOMMAND>
.SH FLAGS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints help information
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
.TP
\fBhelp\fR
Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

.TP
\fBfilter\fR
Joins keys into a keyring applying a filter

This can be used to filter keys based on given predicates,
e.g. whether they have a user id containing an email address with a
certain domain.  Additionally, the keys can be pruned to only include
components matching the predicates.

If no filters are supplied, everything matches.

If multiple predicates are given, they are or'ed, i.e. a key matches
if any of the predicates match.  To require all predicates to match,
chain multiple invocations of this command.  See EXAMPLES for
inspiration.

.TP
\fBjoin\fR
Joins keys or keyrings into a single keyring

Unlike "sq keyring merge", multiple versions of the same key are not
merged together.

The converse operation is "sq keyring split".

.TP
\fBmerge\fR
Merges keys or keyrings into a single keyring

Unlike "sq keyring join", the certificates are buffered and multiple
versions of the same certificate are merged together.  Where data is
replaced (e.g., secret key material), data from the later certificate
is preferred.

.TP
\fBlist\fR
Lists keys in a keyring

Prints the fingerprint as well one userid for every certificate
encountered in the keyring.

.TP
\fBsplit\fR
Splits a keyring into individual keys

Splitting up a keyring into individual keys helps with curating a
keyring.

The converse operation is "sq keyring join".
